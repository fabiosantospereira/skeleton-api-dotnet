# Getting Started

> **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS:** Git has a limit of 4096 characters for filename, but, on windows, the default limit is 260 (because of an older Windows API compatibility). In order to fix `Filename too long`, you must execute `git config --system core.longpaths true` before cloning this repository.
> **IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS:** Linux containers shell scripts don't work when git changes the line endings of the shell files to crlf. In order to avoid shell scripts not working, you must execute `git config --global core.autocrlf false` before cloning this repository.
